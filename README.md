***Objective***  
Build and fine-tune a system that leverages pre-trained transformer models to address real-world tasks. This system will help a student seeking an internship by performing various tasks involving natural language understanding and generation.

***Specifications***

1. **Interactive Command Line Interface**  
   Create a text-based program that interacts with users through open-ended plain-text prompts.

2. **Sentence Auto-Completion**  
   Implement functionality that predicts and completes common sentences based on context. Use your transformer model to generate plausible continuations for user-provided text.

3. **Cover Letter Analysis**  
   Design a feature where the system reads a provided cover letter and extracts meaningful information about the applicant.

4. **Dynamic Cover Letter Generation**  
   Enable the system to generate a personalized cover letter based on user-specified constraints, such as desired role, key skills, or industry. Combine a flexible template with dynamic content generation to meet specific user needs.
